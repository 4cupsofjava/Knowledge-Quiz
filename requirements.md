# Vision:

### What is the vision of this product?

- For users/students (pretend) to be able to log onto the site and take a knowledge assessment regarding JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. They will be presented with
a series of multiple choice questions containing 1 correct answer and 3 incorrect answers. A skip button will also be provided so they can elect to move on to the next
question and then be re-presented with that question later. In the event the answer they choose is incorrect, a helpful link and/or some information about the 
question will be displayed so the user/student can further understand the question's subject. Their score will be tracked in order to provide a final grade at the end of
the test.

Finally, as a teacher (pretend), will be able to log into a more admin role page in order to input custom test questions that will be added to the database, as well as
view student test scores along with some basic student information (Name).

### What pain point does this project solve?

- This project allows for students to receive up-to-date knowledge checks with material that can be easily updated for relevancy. Recalling the knowledge will be 
easier when all in one place, thus reducing the work for the student in accesssing the learning materials.

### Why should we care about your product?

- There are hundreds of students like us that go through Code Fellows every year. We are presented with dozens of new topics and subjects that can become
easily confused if time is not taken to clearly define, practice, and articulate these new terms, nomeclature, or terminology. This quiz structure cleary defines
the subjects into appropriate categories and streamlines the process for reviewing course concepts and materials.
